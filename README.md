# Capstone Project

# LotLock

LotLock is a blockchain-powered platform designed to track, manage, and optimize food supply chains. This repository
contains the codebase for the LotLock project.

The name "LotLock" signifies the security and traceability provided to each food product in a lot or batch in the
supply chain unlike traditional barcode tracking.

## Rice LotLock

Rice LotLock is an example use case implemented within the LotLock platform to demonstrate its capabilities.
It focuses on tracking the journey of rice from production to consumption using blockchain technology.

### Why Rice?

Rice LotLock was chosen as an example for several reasons:

1. **Global Impact:** Rice is a staple food for billions of people worldwide, making it a critical commodity with a
   significant impact on food security and supply chain efficiency.

2. **Complex Supply Chain:** The rice supply chain involves multiple stages, including cultivation, processing,
   distribution, and retail. Tracking rice can showcase the platform's ability to handle diverse food options and
   complex supply chain networks.

3. **Sustainability Concerns:** Rice production has environmental and sustainability challenges, such as water usage
   and greenhouse gas emissions. Implementing blockchain in the rice supply chain can promote transparency, ethical
   sourcing, and sustainability practices.

## Stakeholders and Roles

1. **ROLE_FARMER**: The farmers who cultivate the food items, in this case, rice. They are responsible for the initial
   production and can provide critical data about cultivation practices, harvest times, and more.

2. **ROLE_DISTRIBUTOR**: These are the entities responsible for transporting the food items from the farms to the
   processing units or retailers. They can provide data about the transportation conditions, times, and routes.

3. **ROLE_PROCESSOR**: These stakeholders are involved in transforming the raw food items into a form suitable for
   consumption. For rice, this could involve milling, packaging, and more.

4. **ROLE_RETAILER**: Retailers sell the final products to consumers. They can provide data about sales, stock levels,
   and more.

5. **ROLE_CONSUMER**: The end-users who consume the final product. While they might not interact directly with the
   blockchain, their preferences and feedback can be valuable data points.

6. **ROLE_GOVERNMENT**: Government entities might be involved in regulatory oversight, ensuring compliance with food
   safety standards, and more.

7. **ROLE_EQUIPMENT_RETAILER**: These stakeholders provide the necessary equipment for farming, processing, and more.

8. **ROLE_INVENTORY_MANAGER**: These stakeholders manage the storage of food items at various stages of the supply chain.

9. **ROLE_ADMIN**: Administrators of the LotLock platform who ensure its smooth operation.

10. **ROLE_DATA_ANALYST**: Stakeholders who analyze the data collected through the platform to derive insights and
    make informed decisions.

11. **ROLE_SUSTAINABILITY_AUDITOR**: These stakeholders could monitor and verify the sustainability practices in the
    food supply chain.
