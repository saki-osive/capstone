# Capstone Project 

# FoodChain

FoodChain is a blockchain-powered platform designed to track, manage, and optimize food supply chains. This repository contains the codebase for the FoodChain project.

## About RiceChain

RiceChain is an example use case implemented within the FoodChain platform to demonstrate its capabilities. It focuses on tracking the journey of rice from production to consumption using blockchain technology.

### Why RiceChain?

RiceChain was chosen as an example for several reasons:

1. **Global Impact:** Rice is a staple food for billions of people worldwide, making it a critical commodity with a significant impact on food security and supply chain efficiency.

2. **Complex Supply Chain:** The rice supply chain involves multiple stages, including cultivation, processing, distribution, and retail. Tracking rice can showcase the platform's ability to handle diverse food options and complex supply chain networks.

3. **Sustainability Concerns:** Rice production has environmental and sustainability challenges, such as water usage and greenhouse gas emissions. Implementing blockchain in the rice supply chain can promote transparency, ethical sourcing, and sustainability practices.
